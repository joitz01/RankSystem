The RankSystem offers the following Features

    Custom Rank Gump
    3 Quest Types that have Varied Objectives.
    --- Subjugation, Item Hunting, Escorts --- These quest are how player ranks are acquired.
    Basic Level system to grant player stats and skill points.
    Ranks for all skills. Using each skill will provide a random number for exp towards that skills rank. --- When a skill hits a certain rank, the player will get a skill cap added to that skill. With this in mind, it may be a good idea to disable power scrolls.
    Unique Abilities - This is still lacking, so its a work in progress.
    Item usage counter, which will have future use for unique abilities. Such as counting how many potions are using, how many doors are opened, how many kills with a certain weapon type.
